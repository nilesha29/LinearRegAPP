GCP cloud Deployment steps:
step1: Go to GCP cloud and create a new project
step2: Create a new configuration file named as app.yaml and put the below content inside this newly Created file
        runtime: python
        env: flex
        entrypoint: gunicorn -b :$PORT main:application

        runtime_config:
          python_version: 3

        manual_scaling:
          instances: 1
        resources:
          cpu: 1
          memory_gb: 0.5
          disk_size_gb: 1

step3: Initialize a local git
        git init
        git add .
        git commit -m "any message for commit"

step4: Go to your github.com and create a new repository and provide any name that you want for that repo

step5: Push our code to our github repo(repository)
        git push github_repo_url branch_name
        (to check the branch name -->  git branch)

step6: Go to your GCP cloud

step7: CLick on "Activate cloud shell" which is on the top right corner of your GCP browser view

step8: One the cloud shell is activated go to your cloud shell and clone your github app which we have pushed at step5
        git clone repo_url

step9: On the cloud shell itself get into/navigate the project folder

To disable the application: App Engine --> setting
To shutdown/delete the application: IAM -> Setting --> Shut Down
