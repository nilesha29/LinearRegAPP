step1: Create a new anaconda environment
        conda create -n LinearRegressionApp python==3.6.9

step2: Install the requirements file
        pip install -r requirements.txt

step3: Create a file name as Procfile
        There is no extension for this Procfile
        P should be capital
        write this in Procfile --> web: gunicorn app:app
        When we try to deploy the application on cloud, the cloud needs to know that how to execute, which is the main file,
        what are the commands I should be using to execute the file. So for that we are supposed to tell that
        this the web file so web is mention their.
        first app is the file name.
        On Heroku deployment the main file name should supposed to be app.py if app.py file is not available then create it.
        If the code is available in .py file then Copy the entire code from .py file and paste it to app.py.
        Here copy the entire code from main.py file and paste it to app.py file.
        Second app is for the flask object
        Here the flask object is application, so we are supposed to make it app only.
        e.g., app = Flask(__name__)

step4: Initialise your project as git project
        git init

Step5: Start tracking all the project files
        git add .

In git initialization environment doesnâ€™t matter.
